    <h1>The Opportunity Gap</h1>
    <p>Millions of children in the United States want to join extracurricular programs but cannot. Cost lack of transportation limited local options low bandwidth and minimal public awareness prevent children from exploring their interests and building essential skills.</p>

    <div class="stat">
      <div class="big">22.6 million</div>
      <p>Children whose parents want them in after school programs but cannot access one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stat">
      <div class="big">77%</div>
      <p>Of interested families are turned away because programs are full too expensive or unavailable in their area.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stat">
      <div class="big">43%</div>
      <p>Of U.S. children participate in no extracurricular activities at all indicating huge access gaps.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>A problem with little attention</h2>
    <p>Studies show extracurricular access is one of the strongest predictors of later academic success yet national funding and public awareness remain extremely low. Compared to food security technology access or standardized testing extracurricular inequality receives far less national focus despite being deeply linked to emotional development creativity and opportunity.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      "Most families who want after school learning support cannot find it. The opportunity gap grows each year while demand keeps rising." 
    </div>

    <h2>Why ConnectKids exists</h2>
    <p>Despite huge unmet demand free and online extracurriculars exist but are scattered and unreachable to many families. ConnectKids bridges that gap by collecting trusted free programs and making them easy to access regardless of location or income.</p>
